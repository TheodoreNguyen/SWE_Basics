    "Summary: sort as if you're sorting in real life. Lets have two stacks - original and an empty new one. Grab (pop) item from original. Now, compare item with top of original. If item is smaller or same, put on new stack. (ELSE) If bigger, pop the original again, then push the first item we popped back onto original. push the smaller item onto new stack. repeat until original stack is empty. Afterwards, do the same algorithm, except we've swapped old stack for new stack, and we compare if it is bigger or same instead of the smaller or same mentioned earlier. Stop performing the algorithm if (ELSE) never occurs in an iteration of the algorithm. This means that the stack is sorted. (one of them, that is - whichever one has stuff in it, cuz the other one will be empty)"
